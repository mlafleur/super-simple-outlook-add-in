#Super Simple Outlook Add-in 

This is an example of a stripped down Outlook add-in consisting of only two files.

##Index.html
A simple HTML page that renders the each recipient (to, from and cc) as a simple Persona Card.   
 
##Manifest.xml
A minimum manifest that tells Outlook when and how to use this add-in
